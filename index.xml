      <title>Zellij 0.38.0: including a session-manager, plugin infrastructure improvements and an end to offensive session names</title>

      <description>Session Manager This much requested feature has been implemented as a built-in plugin, allowing users to switch between sessions and move focus to specific tabs or panes in the current or other sessions. And of course, one can fuzzy-find through pane names (often provided by the application running inside the terminal), tab names or session names.
All of this functionality is now available as part of Zellij&amp;rsquo;s plugin API - so users are welcome and encouraged to fork the plugin and change its behavior to their liking.</description>

      <description>Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be cool to be able to develop terminal applets like UI components? Visual scripts to help you automate your workflow, shareable with others and written in Rust?
The Zellij team has just overhauled our WebAssembly plugin system, and we&amp;rsquo;d like to invite plugin developers to build this with us.

      <description>We just released Zellij 0.35.1, including an exciting array of new features and bug fixes. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive in to some of them!
Stacked Panes Stacked panes are a new and unique way to arrange panes in your workspace. You can now arrange panes in a stack, showing only the title line of all but one of them - with the last one expanded just like any other pane.
You can page through them up/down as you would normally move through panes (eg.</description>

We want to grant power users the ability to better harness their terminal workspace, expressing their imagination and sharing their findings with the community.</description>

      <description>We just released Zellij 0.23.0, which adds collaboration features to our terminal multiplexer.
This solution allows multiple users to be attached to the same Zellij session and each have their own cursor. The cursors appear in different colors, giving a Google-docs like experience in the terminal and allowing users to be focused not only on different tabs, but on different panes in the same tab. That way they can see each other type in real time.</description>
